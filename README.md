# Navigation Approach

In this web page, I demonstrated how to create a clickable heading that navigates to a detailed information page. This is achieved by using a hyperlink within a heading tag, styled with CSS to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface.

The HTML structure utilizes an anchor () tag wrapped inside an heading tag. The href attribute of the anchor tag points to the target page, detailed-information.html.

The accompanying CSS provides a minimalistic style, with the .heading-link class ensuring the link appears as regular text and the :hover pseudo-class adding an underline on hover to indicate interactivity.

By following this approach, we can create intuitive navigation within your web pages, enhancing the user experience by clearly indicating clickable elements and ensuring a seamless transition to additional content.
